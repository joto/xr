Experiments With Map Rendering
==============================

These are some experiments with new ways of writing map renderers and their
configuration.

These programs are not meant to be finished in any way, they might solve
some problems and totally ignore others. They are helping me exploring the
problem and solution space from different directions.

All the software here is hereby released into the Public Domain.

For some more background see this blog post:

To execute this code you'll need the GeoRuby and GD ruby gems.

There is some test data in the 'data' directory. Everything you need for
the renderers is in there already. If you want to create some different
test data you'll need 'osmjs' from the Osmium package.
